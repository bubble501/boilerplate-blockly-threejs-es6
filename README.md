# Blockly, es6, browserify, three.js etc

## Installation
Clone the repository and run `npm install`.
Clone the Blockly repository https://github.com/google/blockly inside the build folder. The blockly npm package is not included in the package.json file because I did not find a way to get it working with `require` or `import`.
