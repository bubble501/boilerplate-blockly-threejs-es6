# Blockly, es6, browserify, three.js etc

## Installation
Clone the repository and run `npm install`.

## Clone blocky
Clone the Blockly repository https://github.com/google/blockly inside the build folder. The blockly npm package is not included in the package.json file because it does not play well with the build system.
Once the installation is done, run `gulp`. You should see a page with some blocks to drag and drop
